virtualenv
---------------

To create a new virtualenv, run the command `virtualenv <name of the env>`
To start the virtualenv, run `. <name of the env>\scripts\activate`
To end the virtualenv, run deactivate

Since the virtualenv folder will not get uploaded to github, we may create a requirements.txt
To create the requirements.txt run pip `freeze > requirements.txt` (requirements.txt can be any name)
To install from the requirements.txt run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
